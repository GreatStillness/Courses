Q: How do we model a many-to-many relationship between two database tables?
A: We add a table with two foreign keys
---
Q: In Python, what is a database "cursor" most like?
A: A file handle
---
Q: What method do you call in an SQLIte cursor object in Python to run an SQL command?
A: execute()
---
Q: In the following SQL,
cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE org = ? ', (org, ))
what is the purpose of the "?"?
A: It is a placeholder for the contents of the "org" variable
---
Q: In the following Python code sequence (assuming cur is a SQLite cursor object),
cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE org = ? ', (org, ))
row = cur.fetchone()
what is the value in row if no rows match the WHERE clause?
A: None
---
Q: What does the LIMIT clause in the following SQL accomplish?
SELECT org, count FROM Counts
   ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10
A: It only retrieves the first 10 rows from the table
---
Q: What does the executescript() method in the Python SQLite cursor object do that the normal execute() method does not do?
A: It allows multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons
---
Q: What is the purpose of "OR IGNORE" in the following SQL:
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Course (title) VALUES ( ? )
A: It makes sure that if a particular title is already in the table, there are no duplicate rows inserted
---
Q: For the following Python code to work, what must be added to the title column in the CREATE TABLE statement for the Course table:
cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Course (title)
    VALUES ( ? )''', ( title, ) )
cur.execute('SELECT id FROM Course WHERE title = ? ',
    (title, ))
A: A UNIQUE constraint
---
Q: What do we generally avoid in a many-to-many junction table?
A: An AUTOINCREMENT primary key column/A logical key
