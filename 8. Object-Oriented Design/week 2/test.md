Q: Sam was asked to create a DeliveryDriver class. Sam thought about the problem, and reduced it to its most essential aspectsâ€¦ things like takeOrder, DeliveryArea, etc. She ignored things that were not important in the context, like the driver's height or eye colour. She just applied an important object-oriented design principle. Which of these concepts best describes what she just did?
A: abstraction

Q: Sam identified the important attributes and behaviours of a delivery driver and put them all into a DeliveryDriver class, like "takeOrder", "deliverOrder", and "DeliveryArea." She exposed some of these to other classes. She just demonstrated an important part of object-oriented design. Which of these concepts best describes what you did?
A: encapsulation
---
Q: Sam decided that the DeliveryDriver class was getting too complex, so she split it up, moving its behaviour into several related classes, like DeliveryCar and DeliveryOrder. She just demonstrated which important object-oriented design principle?
A: decomposition
---
Q: Sam realized that her DeliveryDriver class had some behaviour and attributes that could be shared by other classes, like BusDriver and TaxiDriver, so she made a class called Driver that these classes inherited behaviour from. Which object-oriented design principle did she use?
A: generalization
